# Tanzania Water Pumps Prediction Project

## Project Description

The Tanzania Water Pumps Prediction Project is an initiative aimed at improving the management and functionality of water points across Tanzania. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the functionality of water pumps based on various features and data related to these pumps. Additionally, the project seeks to uncover the determinants of water point failure and provide valuable insights for stakeholders.

## Data Source

The project utilizes data from Kaggle's "Tanzania Water Pumps" competition, available at [Kaggle - Tanzania Water Pumps](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ds1-predictive-modeling-challenge). The dataset includes information about water pumps, geographical locations, and other relevant attributes.

## Data Description

The dataset for the Tanzania Water Pumps Prediction Project consists of a comprehensive set of attributes that provide valuable insights into the condition and functionality of water pumps. Below is a summary of the key attributes in the dataset:

- **`id`**: Unique identifier for each water pump.

- **`gps_height`**: Altitude of the waterpoint.
- **`installer`**: Organization that installed the waterpoint.
- **`longitude`**: Geographic longitude of the waterpoint.
- **`latitude`**: Geographic latitude of the waterpoint.
- **`wpt_name`**: Name of the waterpoint.
- **`basin`**: Geographic basin in which the waterpoint is located.
- **`subvillage`**: Sub-village of the waterpoint.
- **`region`**: Administrative region of Tanzania.

- **`district_code`**: Code representing the administrative district.
- **`lga`**: Local government area.
- **`ward`**: Administrative ward.
- **`population`**: Population of the area.
- **`public_meeting`**: Indicator for public meetings.
- **`scheme_management`**: Management of the waterpoint scheme.
- **`scheme_name`**: Name of the waterpoint scheme.
- **`permit`**: Indicator for permit to operate.
- **`construction_year`**: Year of waterpoint construction.
- **`extraction_type`**: Method of water extraction.
- **`extraction_type_group`**: Group of extraction methods.
- **`extraction_type_class`**: Classification of extraction methods.
- **`management`**: Waterpoint management.
- **`management_group`**: Group of management types.
- **`payment`**: Payment type for water service.
- **`payment_type`**: Payment type.
- **`water_quality`**: Quality of water.
- **`quality_group`**: Quality group of water.
- **`quantity`**: Quantity of water.
- **`quantity_group`**: Quantity group of water.
- **`source`**: Water source.
- **`source_type`**: Type of water source.
- **`source_class`**: Classification of water source.
- **`waterpoint_type`**: Type of waterpoint.
- **`waterpoint_type_group`**: Group of waterpoint types.
- **`status_group`**: Target variable indicating waterpoint functionality.
